# varianTeX

## About the Template

[varianTeX](https://variantex.woutdillen.be) is a reusable LaTeX Template for journals in the Humanities. It was originally developed for [Variants](https://journals.openedition.org/variants/) (the journal of the [European Society for Textual Scholarship](https://textualscholarship.eu/)) by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN).

Although the template and its design choices are documented in the code itself (in the form of comments), we have also repared a [documentation wiki](https://github.com/WoutDLN/varianTeX/wiki) with more user-friendly instructions on how to use it.
