## varianTeX

This website hosts instructions for using [varianTeX](https://github.com/WoutDLN/varianTeX), a LaTeX template for journals in the Humanities, based on the [Variants](https://journals.openedition.org/variants/) journal. 

In due time, we will also provide instructions for [editors](foreditors.html) who want to wish to reuse the template for their own journal, alongside our instructions for [authors](forauthors.html) who wish to submit a contribution to [Variants](https://journals.openedition.org/variants/) (the journal of the [European Society for Textual Scholarship](https://textualscholarship.eu/)).

### About varianTeX
[varianTeX](https://github.com/WoutDLN/varianTeX) was originally developed for [Variants](https://journals.openedition.org/variants/) by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN).

Although the template and its design choices are documented in the code itself, a [Wiki](https://github.com/WoutDLN/LaTeXJournal_Variants/wiki) with more user-friendly instructions on how to use it is currently under construction.

### About the Author

This template was developed by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN), a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Antwerp](https://uantwerpen.be) as part of his position as the university's CLARIAH-VL coordinator. He is also the General Editor of the Variants journal from Issue 15 onwards.
