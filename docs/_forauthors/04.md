We will assume for now that the contribution you are planning to submit is an essay - rather than a review. For specific instructions on how to submit a review instead, see **below**.

When you navigate to the `essays` folder, you will find two dummy `.tex` files: `martinez.tex` and `my-essay.tex`. The first of those is a complete LaTeX rendition of an essay by Martinez, Dillen, Bleeker, Sichani, and Kelly that was published in **Variants 14**. The authors have kindly agreed to its publication in this template, so to serve as a reference point for authors who intend to submit their own essay in LaTeX. If you are looking for examples on how to include subtitles (`\subsection{}`), images (`\includegraphics{}`), references (`\cite{}` and its variations), etc. please have a look at their essay. For now, will move on `my-essay.tex` instead:

#### 4.1 Metadata

As the template shows, the first information you will need to provide is your contribution's metadata. The authors are listed in `\contributor{}`, and the essay's title is made explicit in `\contribution{}` – all according to the format provided in the template.

For the running headers in the PDF version of our Journal, we will also need a shorter version of the authors and title – to make sure they fit in a single line. You can leave these fields blank, or you can already make a suggestion for an abbreviation that the editors will take into consideration. 

Below the fields for author names and the essay title, the metadata section is concluded, and the essay begins by opening a "LaTeX environment" with `begin{paper}` – which will be closed at the very end using `end{paper}`. This environment ensures that your essay is formated according to the rules defined in `preamble/environments.tex`.
