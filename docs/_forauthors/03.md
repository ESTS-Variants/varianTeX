Once you have opened the template, you will find template's tree-structure with drop-down menus on the left.  The template will open in the `tex` file `main.tex`. 

<figure class="float-left">
	<img src="assets/img/templatestructure.png"/>
	<figcaption>Navigation menu for the template in Overleaf.</figcaption>
</figure> 

`main.tex` describes a series of commands that tie the document together. By clicking on the PDF icon on the top of the menu structure, you can have a look at how the document will be visualized, and by clicking on the 'split screen' icon (on the top left of your browser window) you can visualize both the code and the PDF side by side.

`main.tex` starts with referencing a number of formatting rules that are defined in `\documentclass` and `\include{preamble/all}`, and then opens the document: 

```
\documentclass[]{scrbook}   
\include{preamble/all}

\begin{document}
\sloppy                         % preferences more space between words over overrunning margins
\lefthyphenmin=3                % suppresses hyphenation after only 1 or 2 characters

\pagenumbering{roman}           
\tableofcontents  
\thispagestyle{empty}
\pagenumbering{arabic}

\part{Essays}
\include{essays/my-essay}
% \include{essays/martinez}     % uncomment to visualize the sample essay

\part{Reviews}
\include{reviews/my-review}

\include{back/authors}
\end{document}
```
As you may have guessed, the `\include` command allows us to *include* a number of different documents (also `.tex` files) in the template's larger structure. `include{preamble/all}`, for example, will include the `all.tex` file that can be found in the `preamble` folder in the navigation menu. Similarly, the two documents that we will be working with (`my-essay.tex` and `my-review.tex`) can be respectively be found in the `essays` and `reviews` folders. Since they are both referenced in `main.tex` file, they will also be included in the PDF we are generating.
