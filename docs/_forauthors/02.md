Once you have created an account, you can follow [this link to the Overleaf Template we designed for our Authors](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/submission-template-to-variants-for-authors/znsqffgrvshv). If you're not logged in yet, do so now (top right corner), and press the **Open as Template** button. This will start a new LaTeX project in your Overleaf Account, that already includes the bare-bones structure of our template.
