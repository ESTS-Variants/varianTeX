title: What is LaTeX?
---
LaTeX (pronounced *lah-tekh* or *lay-tekh*) is a useful tool for the creation of documents in which you separate the content from the typesetting. To be precise, it is a document markup language and document preparation system for the TeX typesetting program. That means that you indicate that a certain part of the text is a title instead of styling it as a title like you would do in a word processor like MS Word or Open Office. In that respect, it is similar to TEI/XML – although the syntax is different. For example, a title in TEI/XML would look like this :

```
<title>What is text, really?</title>
```

A title in LaTeX looks like this

```
\title{What is text, really?}
```

The great advantage of LaTeX is that authors can concentrate on the content of their work. They  do not need to worry about the design and appearance of their documents; it’s up to the editors or publishers to decide how text marked as `title` will represented. Accordingly, LaTeX removes a significant burden from editors with regard to typesetting and styling the documents they receive for publication.
