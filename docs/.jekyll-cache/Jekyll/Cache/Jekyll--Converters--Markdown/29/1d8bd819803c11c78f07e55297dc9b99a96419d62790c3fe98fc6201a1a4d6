<p>We will assume for now that the contribution you are planning to submit is an essay - rather than a review. For specific instructions on how to submit a review instead, see <strong>below</strong>.</p>

<p>When you navigate to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">essays</code> folder, you will find two dummy <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> files: <code class="highlighter-rouge">martinez.tex</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">my-essay.tex</code>. The first of those is a complete LaTeX rendition of an essay by Martinez, Dillen, Bleeker, Sichani, and Kelly that was published in <strong>Variants 14</strong>. The authors have kindly agreed to its publication in this template, so to serve as a reference point for authors who intend to submit their own essay in LaTeX. If you are looking for examples on how to include subtitles (<code class="highlighter-rouge">\subsection{}</code>), images (<code class="highlighter-rouge">\includegraphics{}</code>), references (<code class="highlighter-rouge">\cite{}</code> and its variations), etc. please have a look at their essay. For now, will move on <code class="highlighter-rouge">my-essay.tex</code> instead:</p>

<h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3>

<p>As the template shows, the first information you will need to provide is your contributionâ€™s metadata. The authors are listed in <code class="highlighter-rouge">\contributor{}</code>, and the essayâ€™s title is made explicit in <code class="highlighter-rouge">\contribution{}</code> â€“ all according to the format provided in the template.</p>

<p>For the running headers in the PDF version of our Journal, we will also need a shorter version of the authors and title â€“ to make sure they fit in a single line. You can leave these fields blank, or you can already make a suggestion for an abbreviation that the editors will take into consideration.</p>
