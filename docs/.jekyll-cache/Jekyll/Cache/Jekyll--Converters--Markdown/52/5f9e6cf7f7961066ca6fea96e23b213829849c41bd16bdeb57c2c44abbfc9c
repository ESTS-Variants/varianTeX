I"„<p>We will assume for now that the contribution you are planning to submit is an essay - rather than a review. For specific instructions on how to submit a review instead, see <strong>below</strong>.</p>

<p>When you navigate to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">essays</code> folder, you will find two dummy <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> files: <code class="highlighter-rouge">martinez.tex</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">my-essay.tex</code>. The first of those is a complete LaTeX rendition of an essay by Martinez, Dillen, Bleeker, Sichani, and Kelly that was published in <strong>Variants 14</strong>. The authors have kindly agreed to its publication in this template, so to serve as a reference point for authors who intend to submit their own essay in LaTeX. If you are looking for examples on how to include subtitles (<code class="highlighter-rouge">\subsection{}</code>), images (``), references (<code class="highlighter-rouge">\cite{}</code>), etc. please have a look at their essay.</p>
