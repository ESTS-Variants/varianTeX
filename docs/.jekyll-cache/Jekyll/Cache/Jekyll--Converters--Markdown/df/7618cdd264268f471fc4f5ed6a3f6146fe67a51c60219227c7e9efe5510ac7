I"Å<p>There are different ways to work with LaTeX, but if you‚Äôre new to it we recommend the online editor <a href="https://overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>. You do not need to install any software to work with Overleaf, just a web browser and a (free) Overleaf-account. It is similar to Google docs in the sense that you can work with multiple authors in one document and that the changes you make are automatically saved. Another advantage of Overleaf is that it automatically compiles your LaTeX document in your browser, so that you can see the immediate effect of the changes you make.</p>

<p>Note that this is a commercial application, and may at any point become a subscription-only service or go offline. There are also standalone, opensource alternatives for writing LaTeX on your  own system, but because they are a little less userfriendly we still recommend using Overleaf at this point.</p>
