<h3 id="what-is-latex">What is LaTeX?</h3>
<p>LaTeX (pronounced <em>lah-tekh</em> or <em>lay-tekh</em>) is a useful tool for the creation of documents in which you separate the content from the typesetting. To be precise, it is a document markup language and document preparation system for the TeX typesetting program. That means that you indicate that a certain part of the text is a title instead of styling it as a title like you would do in a word processor like MS Word or Open Office. In that respect, it is similar to TEI/XML – although the syntax is different. For example, a title in TEI/XML would look like this :</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;title&gt;What is text, really?&lt;/title&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A title in LaTeX looks like this</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>\title{What is text, really?}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The great advantage of LaTeX is that authors can concentrate on the content of their work. They  do not need to worry about the design and appearance of their documents; it’s up to the editors or publishers to decide how text marked as <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> will represented. Accordingly, LaTeX removes a significant burden from editors with regard to typesetting and styling the documents they receive for publication.</p>

<p>Extensive general user documentation including a <a href="https://overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes">Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes</a>-guide can be found at <a href="https://overleaf.com/learn">https://overleaf.com/learn</a>.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-make-a-latex-file">Where can I make a LaTeX file?</h3>
<p>There are different ways to work with LaTeX, but if you’re new to it we recommend the online editor <a href="https://overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>. You do not need to install any software to work with Overleaf, just a web browser and a (free) Overleaf-account. It is similar to Google docs in the sense that you can work with multiple authors in one document and that the changes you make are automatically saved. Another advantage of Overleaf is that it automatically compiles your LaTeX document in your browser, so that you can see the immediate effect of the changes you make.</p>

<p>Note that this is a commercial application, and may at any point become a subscription-only service or go offline. There are also standalone, opensource alternatives for writing LaTeX on your  own system, but because they are a little less userfriendly we still recommend using Overleaf at this point.</p>
