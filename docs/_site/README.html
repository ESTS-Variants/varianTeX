<p>This website hosts instructions for using <a href="https://github.com/WoutDLN/VariantX">VariantX</a>, a LaTeX template for journals in the Humanities, based on the <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/variants/">Variants</a> journal.</p>

<p>In due time, we will also provide instructions for <a href="foreditors.html">editors</a> who want to wish to reuse the template for their own journal, alongside our instructions for <a href="forauthors.html">authors</a> who wish to submit a contribution to <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/variants/">Variants</a> (the journal of the <a href="https://textualscholarship.eu/">European Society for Textual Scholarship</a>).</p>

<h3 id="about-variantx">About VariantX</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/WoutDLN/VariantX">VariantX</a> was originally developed for <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/variants/">Variants</a> by <a href="https://github.com/WoutDLN">Wout Dillen</a>.</p>

<p>Although the template and its design choices are documented in the code itself, a <a href="https://github.com/WoutDLN/LaTeXJournal_Variants/wiki">Wiki</a> with more user-friendly instructions on how to use it is currently under construction.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h3>

<p>This template was developed by <a href="https://github.com/WoutDLN">Wout Dillen</a>, a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://uantwerpen.be">University of Antwerp</a> as part of his position as the universityâ€™s CLARIAH-VL coordinator. He is also the General Editor of the Variants journal from Issue 15 onwards.</p>
